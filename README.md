# py-repository
Python repository for useful functions and methods for data manipulation and transformation

While I am learning Python I am creating a reproducible repository with common functions and methods I have been utilising which I hope people will find useful when they are starting out too.
I am already finding myself searching through various Jupyter Notebooks to find specific functions and how I approached the same problem. Rather than wait 5 years to do this like I did with R, Iâ€™m starting it after a few months of working in Python.

In general I will be focusing on:

1. Basic data manipulation and analysis
2. String manipulations
3. Defining and working in functions
4. Loops and lists
5. Automating excel creation
